   (on Windows) or `source myenv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux)
   4. Install the required packages using pip by running the command `pip install
   package_name`
   5. Deactivate the virtual environment by running the command `deactivate`
   Note: You can also use conda to create and manage virtual environments.


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   Here is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:
   print("Hello, World!")
   Explanation of the basic syntax elements used in the program:
   1. `print()`: This is a built-in function in Python that prints its argument
   to the console.
   2. `"Hello, World!"`: This is a string literal, which is a sequence
   of characters enclosed in quotes.
   3. `()` : These are parentheses, which are used to enclose the arguments
   of a function.
   4. `;` : This is not required in Python, unlike some other languages.
   Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define block-level structure.
   

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   Basic data types in Python:
   1. Integers (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 1, 2
   2. Floating Point Numbers (float): Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14
   3. Strings (str): Sequences of characters, e.g., "hello", '
   hello'
   4. Boolean (bool): True or False values
   5. List (list): Ordered collections of items, e.g., [1,
   2, 3]
   6. Tuple (tuple): Ordered, immutable collections of items, e.g., (1
   , 2, 3)
   7. Dictionary (dict): Unordered collections of key-value pairs, e.g., {"
   name": "John", "age": 30}
   8. Set (set): Unordered collections of unique items, e.g., {1
   , 2, 3}
   # Numeric types
age = 25  #int
pi = 3.14159  # float
complex_num = 1j  # complex

# String type
name = "Bob"  # str

# Boolean type
is_raining = True  # bool

# Collection types
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  # list
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")  # tuple
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3}  # set (duplicate 2 is removed)
person = {"name": "Charlie", "age": 40, "city": "New York"}  # dict

# Print the data types and values
print("Integer:", age, type(age))
print("Float:", pi, type(pi))
print("Complex:", complex_num, type(complex_num))
print("String:", name, type(name))
print("Boolean:", is_raining, type(is_raining))
print("List:", fruits, type(fruits))
print("Tuple:", colors, type(colors))
print("Set:", unique_numbers, type(unique_numbers))
print("Dictionary:", person, type(person))


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   Conditional Statements (if-else):
   Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions. In Python, we use
   `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords to create conditional statements.
   Example of an if-else statement:

   studied = bool(input("Have you studied (True/False)? "))

if studied:
  print("Great job! You're likely to succeed.")
else:
  print("It might be wise to hit the books! There's a chance of failing.")

  Example of a for loop:
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)



6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   Functions
   Functions are reusable blocks of code that take arguments, execute a series of statements, and return a
   value. They are useful for:
   - Code organization and reusability
   - Reducing code duplication
   - Improving code readability
   - Making code more modular and maintainable
   Example of a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
   def add_numbers(a, b):  
   return a + b
   Example of how to call this function:
   result = add_numbers(5, 3)
   print("The sum is:", result)
   Output: The sum is: 8


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   Lists and Dictionaries differences;
   Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers,
   floats, and other lists. They are defined using square brackets `[]` and elements are separated
   by commas.
   Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are defined using curly braces `{}`
   and elements are separated by commas.
   Example script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then
   demonstrates basic operations on both:
   # Create a list of numbers
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   print("Original list:", numbers)
   # Append an element to the list
   numbers.append(6)
   print("List after appending:", numbers)
   # Create a dictionary with some key-value pairs
   person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New
   York"}
   print("Original dictionary:", person)
   # Access a value in the dictionary using its key
   print("Name:", person["name"])
   # Update a value in the dictionary
   person["age"] = 31
   print("Dictionary after updating:", person)
   Output:
   Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   List after appending: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
   6]
   Original dictionary: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': '
   New York'}
   Name: John
   Dictionary after updating: {'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'city':
   'New York'}


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors so that the normal flow of the
   application can be maintained. It allows us to write code that can anticipate and recover from
   exceptions (errors) that may occur during execution.
   Example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors
   in a Python script:
   def get_user_age(prompt):
   while True:
   try:
   age = int(input(prompt))
   if age < 0 or age > 150:
   raise ValueError("Invalid age")
   except ValueError as e:
   print(f"Error: {e}")
   else:
   print(f"User is {age} years old.")
   finally:
   print("Thanks for providing your age!")
   get_user_age("Enter your age: ")
   In this example, we have a function `get_user_age` that prompts the user to enter
   their age. The `try` block attempts to convert the user's input into an integer and
   checks if the age is within a valid range. If the age is invalid, a `Value
   Error` is raised. The `except` block catches the `ValueError` and prints an
   error message. The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an
   exception was raised or not, and it prints a thank-you message.
   


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   In Python, a module is a single file that contains a collection of related code, such as
   functions, classes, and variables. A package is a collection of modules that are
   distributed together. Modules and packages provide a way to organize and reuse code in
   Python programs.
   To import and use a module in your script, you can use the `import` statement.
   Example using the `math` module:
   import math
   # Calculate the square root of a number
   num = 16
   sqrt = math.sqrt(num)
   print(f"The square root of {num} is {sqrt:.2f}")
   In this example, we import the `math` module, which provides a collection of
   mathematical functions. We then use the `sqrt` function from the `math` module to
   calculate the square root of a number.
   

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    Reading from a file in Python:
    You can read from a file in Python using the `open` function, which returns a file
    object. The `open` function takes two arguments: the name of the file and the mode
    in which to open the file. The mode can be `'r'` for reading, `'
    w'` for writing, or `'a'` for appending.
    Example script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console:
    def read_file(filename):
    try:
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    read_file("example.txt")
    In this example, we define a function `read_file` that takes a filename as an
    argument. We use the `with` statement to open the file in read mode (`'r
    '`). The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after it is no
    longer needed. We then read the content of the file using the `read` method and
    print it to the console. If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is
    raised, and we catch it to print an error message.
    Writing to a file in Python:
    You can write to a file in Python using the `open` function, which returns a file
    object. The `open` function takes two arguments: the name of the file and the mode
    in which to open the file. The mode can be `'w'` for writing, `'
    a'` for appending, or `'x'` for exclusive creation.
    Example script that writes a list of strings to a file:
    def write_to_file(filename, content):
    try:
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
    for line in content:
    file.write(line + "\n")
    except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    content = ["Hello", "World", "This", "is", "a", "test
    write_to_file("example.txt", content)
    In this example, we define a function `write_to_file` that takes a filename and a
    list of strings as arguments. We use the `with` statement to open the file in
    write mode (`'w'`). The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed
    after it is no longer needed. We then iterate over the list of strings and write
    each string to the file using the `write` method, followed by a newline character
    (`\n`). If an I/O error occurs, an `IOError` is raised,
    and we catch it to print an error message.
